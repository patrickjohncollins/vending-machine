# Coding a vending machine

This is an example project that I created to demonstrate how I would go about coding a vending machine in JavaScript and Angular.

Installation instructions are the same as those for the [Angular seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

Further information may be found on [my website article](http://patrickcollins.fr/code/coding-a-vending-machine/).
